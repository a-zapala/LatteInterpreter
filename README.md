# Latte Interpreter

Interpreter for Latte language which is very similar to Java. 

Src folder contains files which are generated by BNF Converter from Latte.cf.
I've changed a bit AbsLatte.hs for better printing.
I wrote myself:
* Interpreter.hs
* TypeChecker.hs
* Main.hs

# Implemented:
* three basic types: int, string, boolean
* standard programming constructions: arithmetic, comparisions, variables, assignments
* while and if construction
* print function
* passing arguments by value or reference
* static binding, shadowing identifiers
* errors handling
* high order functions, anonymous function, nested function
* recursion
* static type checking
